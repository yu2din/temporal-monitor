# LCARS Temporal Monitor

## About
Star Trek LCARS-themed Pomodoro timer built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and localStorage.

## Design Rules
- LCARS color palette: Orange (#FF9900), Peach (#FFCC99), Purple (#CC99CC), Blue (#9999FF), Red (#CC6666), Tan (#FFCC66)
- Black background, no white/gray backgrounds
- Rounded pill shapes, not sharp corners
- Star Trek terminology: "cycles" not "pomodoros", "mission log" not "session history"

## Known Bugs
- CSS overflow: middle color bars (header peach bar, footer gold bar) bleed beyond frame — NOT FIXED YET, parked for later

## Next Features to Build
1. "Current Objective" text input above timer (saves to localStorage, included in session data)
2. CSV export button for mission log
3. Efficiency percentage in stats bar
